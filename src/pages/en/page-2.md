Getting everyone to play by pinging them individually is exhausting and time consuming. But with Bucket Helper in your server, pinging your best friends is easy.

## The `vc` command
- Usage*: `vc`
- Output: `vc? @yourRoleHere`
- **The command can also be tailored to your liking, for example if you have different roles for games or ping-roles.**<br><br>
  - Example: `mc` will result in `mc? @ping-role` or `Minecraft anybody? @ping-role`.
