## Detection

Bucket Helper can detect bad words in messages and is able to delete them.

#### The bad word list
The default bad word list is quite bland and is missing a bunch of bad words. But you are able to add words to this list! To do so, contact UphillBucket687#7175.

#### Punishments
Users can be punished because of writing bad words through a kick or ban.





Sidenote: Warns and Kick after repeated offenses will be added in the future.
